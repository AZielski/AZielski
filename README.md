- 👋🏻 Hi, my name is Alan and i'm working as fullstack developer with use of C# on backend and React.ts on Frontend.
- 👀 I'm interested in reading books related to self-development. I'm also interested in development in topics like game development or psychology. It's very intresting how our minds or behaviours works.
- 📕 I'm currently learning Go and Rust. These two languages seems spellbinding for me. They are strict typed as C# so i caught nice flow in these regions.
- 🤝🏻 I'm looking to collaborate on some project that involve C#, Go or Rust as main language that are in scope of my interest or are backend or game engines.
- 📫 You can reach me through Discord: Smibios#7602 or mail zielinski.alan@outlook.com
